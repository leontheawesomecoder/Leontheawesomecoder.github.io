Python Loops

So, this week in python we learned how to use "While()" and “For()” loops, which were actually quite simple in the end. I also tried something new, which was to sit at the front and engage with incoming questions to get a better understanding of my work, and to help me add more flavour to my code and make it better. For my homework, I spent **_TWO HOURS _**coding some more questions into my code. I feel like they were well spent, as they would probably just been used for gaming or something like that! Here is an iframe (Cool right!).
