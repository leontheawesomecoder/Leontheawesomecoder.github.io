Scratch

This week I started doing scratch again, and i tried making a game in which a 2d sprite would be able to move around a 2d world. I realised that for this to occur, then the character would need to stay in the same place and the world would need to move around it. Then I tried to get movement mechanics in place by having a linear series of sprites to switch through. I created these by removing the legs of my sprite and replacing them, and the end product was pretty good!

This week I learned the importance of if, forever and if else moderators, and I built upon my skills of general problem solving, perseverance, and smarter code thinking!
