Scratch 2

This week, I made huge improvements in my game, and I managed to create different biomes with the Paint/Fill tool. It was quite easy as the grass background was already '8bit' and retro. I learned how to make something react to two keys at once, so the player can hold up and right to move up and right at the same time, rather than just up then right at different times.

The skills I learned this lesson were how to create variables with actual use, and how to send messages between sprites. This helped me to create events that happened between sprites. This lesson i feel I was more productive than other lessons as I sat away from certain â€¦ distractions!
