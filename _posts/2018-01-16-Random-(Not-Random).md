Random (Not Random)

When someone says the word "Random", what do you think of? The Lottery? Your Spotify playlist? Well, suprise suprise! It's not random. The definition of random is “Made, done, or happening without method or conscious decision.”.This means that if the result of a list was truly random, then the result could return as 1, 2, 3, 4, E.T.C. But to people, this is not random. It just isn’t “Random” enough, no, to them, “Random” means an order in which the results are not close together, and they can’t be predicted. Google, Apple and Amazon have all got music services, and their “Shuffle” button is programmed to not let the songs be to close to prevent the people complaining that the results are not random, when in fact they are. With hundreds of millions of people using their software, there are going to be cases everyday of the 1, 2, 3, 4 order happening, so they need this function.

Computers don't do random. It is impossible. It is one of the only things that a computer can't do, but there will always be something preventing it from being random, so what is random? If a computer can’t do it, it needs to be something from humans. A clever solution to this is a microphone in the middle of London that people travelling to work, shops and tourists travel around in, and can’t be coordinated. Thanks, Goodbye.
