Restarting Python 

Today we had a new teacher, Mr. Keen. He told us that we would be starting to do python, and we started the lesson by refreshing our knowledge from last year, when we touched briefly on the coding language. We revised print, lower and upper, functions and for homework I revised some about arguments. I feel like the lesson went well as a whole, but I need to be faster with my typing and also my remembrance of the functions.
