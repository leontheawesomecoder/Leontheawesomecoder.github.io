Last lesson we discussed why current exam schemes are trash and why they need to be changed. We talked about how we are run by a government who does not know about education or how to teach, but they think they have it all sorted out. Right now, the exams are purely based off memory and how many facts you can remember, also you have to continue doing an exam until you pass it on a core subjects, and not non core subjects.

We also talked about how the only real skill based exam was computer science and PSHE, but there is no exam for the later.

I feel like this should change and we should have some teachers running the education  system and let them make the exams on how they believe it should be run.
