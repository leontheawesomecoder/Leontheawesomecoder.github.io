Lesson one

In our first lesson of blogs, I feel as if I have done well, and I completed all of our tasks, which was to create a function that turned a word in a box and broke it down into separate letters. I handled the task well, and as a result, got it right. The task was quite easy, so I didn't feel hard, more like a warm up, and I can't wait for next week!

The things I could have done better include the fact that I did not know how to change the colour of the cells, but I know how to perform a VLOOKUP. This could be fixed by going on to sheets and familiarizing myself with some of the tools on it. 

I want to find out how to make a real time coder, so I can see the result as I type it in instead of typing in the word, hitting enter and then the result popping up. This may not be possible so I am currently looking into it.

So, in all, I think this lesson was a success!
