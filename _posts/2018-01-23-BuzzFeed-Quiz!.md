BuzzFeed Quiz!

This lesson we were instructed to take a BuzzFeed quiz (As the title probably suggests), the website is full of quizzes to do that are mostly stupid such as "How creative are you?" (I got 98%!), but the point was to see the mathematics behind it, which we found to be a few possible solutions, but not many reliable ones, as for some of them they included ordering the answers in the question line, so if the person found out what was going on, they could very easily manipulate the answers. I have got the questions here:

1. If you were on a sinking ship, what would you do?

1. Grab a lifeboat and save myself!

2. Try and find my family and stick together.

3. Lose it and panic.

4. Collect food and water.

      2.  What will I do at home?

1. Watch YouTube/Social Media?

2. Play some Games!

3. Eat *all* the food!

4. Do my homework.

      3. My favourite subjects are:

1. Art, Graphics, Drama.

2. Maths, Physics, Chemistry.

3. English, History, Geography.

4. Games, PE, Lunch.

      4. I like to play:

1. Fortnite, PUBG, COD.

2. FIFA, Wii Sport (Great game!), MADDEN.

3. Clash Of Clans.

4. Online Solitaire.

      5. I want do drive a:

1. Bugatti Veyron Supersport!

2. Ariel Atom!

3. Toyota Prius.

4. Fiat 50000000!

      6. Petsâ€¦

1. Cute and Cuddly!

2. Brave and Valiant.

3. Well-groomed.

4. Eater of Worlds.

Bye!
