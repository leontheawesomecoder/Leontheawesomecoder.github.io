Virtual Shop

This week, I made a virtual shop, where customers can pretend to buy items, and my spreadsheet will work out how much it will end up costing them to buy whatever they wanted. A cool feature of it is that instead of needing to type it in every time, I have a drop-down box that lets me quickly select items without the possibility of having a typin erroe in the text. Currently I am trying to make it possible to have offers or deals without having to work everything out which is low time and accuracy efficient. And that is basically it!
