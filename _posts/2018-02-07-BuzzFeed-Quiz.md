BuzzFeed Quiz 

Today we carried on with our BuzzFeed quiz, we learned about how to code the questions and I now know what maths I am going to use in order to ensure that the user gets the fair result that they would from the input given. I feel like I was quite productive this lesson but I could have asked a few more questions when I didn't understand to save time in the end. I will really power through next lesson.
